Inheritance in Java

there are 4 part of OOP:
  -encopsulation
  -inheritance
  -abstraction
  -polymorhism
  
  In a single class we can put:
  -instance variable
  -methods
  -constructors
  -static block
  -init block
  -static methods
  -static variables
  
  Inheritance:
       When one class acquired/inherits variables  and methods from another class
           Parent class
           child class inherits methods and variables from parents class
    
     Is - A relation 
     
     Parent class: Drink
     Child class: Coffee
     Coffee Is - A drink
     Tea Is - A drink
     Smoothie Is-A Drink  
     
     
     Inheritance is process when once class acquires the properties of another class.
     Inherits methods and Variables from another class
     
  Extends keyword: is used to establish inheritance relation between classes                  
  Parent class: Drink
  Child class: Coffee
  
  public class Drink{
      String name;
  }
  
  public class Coffee extends Drink{
          -reusable code
          -easier to maintain 
          -good programming design teschnique
  }
  =========================================================
  
  Drink: parent class    (naming same thing)
         supper class 
         base class
  
  Coffee: child class    (naming same thing)
          sub class
          derived class
          
 ========================= 
  Drink > Coffee > Cappucino
  
  Drink > Tea > Green tea > jasmine+GreenTea
  
  public class Drink{
        String name;
  }
  
  public class Coffee extends Drink{
         int caffeineCount;
  }
  
  =========================
  Variables and methods in Drink class is available/inherited to Coffee class.
  
  If Coffee class adds its own   variable or method, it will not be available for drink class.
  
  =============================
  
  
  public class Drink{
        String name;
  }
  
  public class Coffee extends Drink{
         int caffeineCount;
  }
  
  public class Tea extends Drink{
  
  }
  
         Drink
 
    Coffee     Tea
  
  
  Java does not support multiple inheritan:
  Coffee -> Drink 
         -> Beverage
         
 public class Coffee extends Drink, beverage{
    
 }        
  Above code will not work in java. In Java a class can extend only one class. Class can have only parent/super class
  ==============================
  
  Super/Parent/Base class:
       Vehicle: makeAndModel
                year
                maxSpeed
                
 Sub/child Class:
        Car: 
  
 CarMax => main method is here 
          there is no inheritance relation between carMax and Vehicle or Car.
          We are just creating objects there.
          It is just a runner class
