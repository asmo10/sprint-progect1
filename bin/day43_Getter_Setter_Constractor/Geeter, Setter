Encapsulation


Good Encapsulation practice making instance  fields private and providing public getter/ setter for the field for success and modify

Getter—>> Method for getting the value of your fields and name is specifically recommended in getFieldName() format and return the value of field.



Setter—>> a Method for setting the value of your field and name specifically suggested to have setFieldName(dataType fieldName)and it  will set new value for the field and it does not return value

Create a class called Vehicle 
with few private fields model , make , speed 
create getters and setters for all those private fields 

create methods : 
	increaseSpeed : it accepts one parameter increaseBy as int 
	and increase the speed to new speed. 
	if your current speed is 10 and you pass 5 to this method , outcome should be  ---> 10->11->12->13->14->15->

	decreaseSpeed  : 
	it accepts one parameter decreaseBy as int 
	and decrease the speed to new speed. 
	if your current speed is 10 and you pass 5 to this method , outcome should be  ---> 10->9->8->7->6->5->
